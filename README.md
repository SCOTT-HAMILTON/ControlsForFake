# Todo - work in progress

 * Translations (french only, I don't speak that much languages, help is welcomed)
 * Meson qt5 module is obscure, I didn't find anyway of telling meson to compile the 
 translation files before preprocessing the ressource files. This is why I keep those
 ugly precompiled qm files ðŸ¤®. If you know how to fix this, please tell me.
